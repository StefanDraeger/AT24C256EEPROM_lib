## Arduino AT24C Library
This tiny library is for read and write data to I2C EEPROMs at Arduino microcontrollers.

The code is copied from https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/I2CEEPROM/ so Iam not the original autor.
My service is only the transformation into a library so that the functions can be reused more easily.
